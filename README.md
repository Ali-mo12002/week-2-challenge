# week-2-challenge

# The aim of this project was to create a fully functional portfolio for when after we finish the bootcamp. There were many criteras that had to be met.

# One criteria was that when the page was loaded, the user is presented with the developers name and links to them and their work and contact information. 
# This was all done in the header as shown below.

# Another criteria that i met was when the user clicked one of the links in the header then the ui scrolls to that part of the page.
# Their is an about me section which gives the user abit of background information on the developer. the screenshot below shows this.

# when the user clicks of one of the links in the projects section, they are directed to that project. When they hover over one of the projects, the title for that project changes to white. the image for the first project is also bigger than the rest.
